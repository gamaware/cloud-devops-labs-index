- Access request system for private repositories
- Multilingual support (English, Spanish, Portuguese)

### Purpose

The primary purposes of this website are:

1. **Educational Resource Hub**: Centralize access to cloud and DevOps educational materials
2. **Professional Portfolio**: Showcase professional experience and certifications
3. **Repository Access Management**: Streamline the process for granting access to private lab repositories
4. **Student Engagement**: Provide a professional interface for students to access course materials

## Website Structure

The website consists of the following main components:

```

6. **Footer**: Copyright information and disclaimer

## Key Features

### Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full layout with multi-column sections
- Tablet: Adjusted layout with some single-column sections

- All content is translated, including form fields and buttons
- Language preference is saved in localStorage

### Repository Access System

- Custom form for requesting access to private repositories
- GitHub-based workflow for processing access requests
- Automated collaborator addition upon approval

## Repository Access Workflow

The repository access system follows this workflow:

1. **User Submits Request**:
   - User fills out the access request form on `access-request.html`
   - Form validates email format and GitHub username existence
   - Form creates a GitHub issue with the request details

2. **Issue Creation**:
   - GitHub issue is created with standardized format
   - Issue is labeled with "access-request" and "pending-approval"
   - Issue is assigned to repository owner

3. **Review Process**:
   - Repository owner receives notification of new access request
   - Owner reviews request details in the GitHub issue
   - Owner approves or denies with simple commands

4. **Access Granting**:
   - Upon approval, GitHub Actions workflow adds user as collaborator
   - User receives notification of access being granted
   - Issue is closed and labeled as "approved"

5. **Denial Process**:
   - If denied, issue is closed and labeled as "denied"
   - User receives notification of denial

```

## Technical Implementation

### Front-End Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling with custom properties for theming
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and form handling
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for social links and UI elements

### GitHub Integration

- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the static website
- **GitHub Issues**: Managing access requests
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating the access granting process

### Automation

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Processes access requests and adds collaborators
- **Issue Templates**: Standardizes the format of access requests
- **Form Validation**: Ensures data quality before submission

## Maintenance and Updates

### Adding New Labs

To add new lab repositories:

1. Create the new repository on GitHub
2. Update the project cards in `index.html`
3. Add the repository to the dropdown options in:
   - `access-request.html`
   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/access-request.yml`

### Adding New Languages

To add support for a new language:

1. Add a new language button in the language selector
2. Add translations to the `translations` object in both HTML files
3. Update the `translatePage` function to handle any language-specific elements

### Updating Styles

Currently, styles are defined inline in the HTML files. To improve maintainability:

1. Move all styles to the `styles.css` file
2. Link the stylesheet in both HTML files
3. Remove inline styles from HTML

This will make future styling updates more efficient and consistent.
